## LA-from-Scratch

This repo aims to implement **Laplace Approximation (LA)** from scratch for a tiny MLP. This is mainly for my own understanding of how LA works.

Each posterior structure is implemented in a self-contained single Python file to make it easy to follow.


## Looking for a Production Library?

If you're looking to simply use the Laplace Approximation in your work, the excellent [`laplace-redux`](https://github.com/AlexImmer/laplace-redux) library is where you should go.
